## Understanding the basics of project management
- **What is a project** is a serie of tasks that need to be completed to reach the desired outcome.Reaching that desired outcome involves collaboration and careful planning that keepts the project on track and on budget. IT has a defined begining and end.
- **What is PM? Why is important** It is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requeriments and achieve the desired outcome . It is valuable for business because it ensures that a project delivers the expected outcomes.
- **What does a project manager do?** He/she follow a process that involves **planing and organizing**, **managing tasks**, budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget (and ensure that it brings value to the company)
- **habilities project manager:** manage task, plan an organize, budget and control cost
- **roles**

- project managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of projects
- Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as
- a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs across an entire organization. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary.

# Module 2 : becoming an effective project management

## Exploring how a project manager adds value

<p align="center";font-size:20pt>
<img  src="https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/f00c2eae-fc5e-4d96-b185-7b64b0889564" width="300" height="150" > 
</p>
              
   
  **Priorization**  of task required to complete a project (break large tasks into small ones)
  **Delegation** Project mamangers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can be best complete the work.
  **Effective communication** Porject managers deliver value through effective communication, bot with their team and with key stakeholders.
  
## How project managers impact organizations

**a.Focusing on the customer** 

 - customer refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as
budget and deadlines. 2 types>
 - internal: stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments
 - external: customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers
- To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards. To meet the customer’s standards, you have to make sure you clearly understand their expectations
- First, sit with the customer and ask what problem they are trying to solve.
- You might ask if they have a specific vision of the final
outcome they would like delivered.
- Ask questions:

<p align="center";font-size:20pt>
<img  src="https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/d6c11103-3dba-4340-95fe-8883af0362e6)" width="300" height="150" > 
</p> 

- Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

**b.Building a great team** 

**c.Fostering relationshipts and communication** 
- The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.
-  Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

**d.Managing the project** 
- Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.
  
**e.Breaking down barriers**
- Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share
ideas.
- How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try
new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If
your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to
the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule.

## Learning more about project manager roles and responsibilities

Project manager responsibilities>

**a.planning and organizing** 
- making use of productivity tools and creating processes
- create plans, timeliness, schedules, and other forms of doc. to track the project completition
  
**b.managing tasks**
  - A project task is an activity that nees to be accomplished within a set peeriod of time by you, your team or your stakeholderes.
    
**c.budgeting and controlling costs and other factors**
- monitor and manage the budget
- track issues and risks

**a. Teaching and mentoring**: When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

**b. Building relationships**: Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

**c. Controlling change**: The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

**d.Empowering your team**
We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

**e.Communicating status and concerns**
As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

<ins>A project manager’s role within a team</ins>

- a Project Manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team
- he/she is the person who manage the task of the project, what that means?
- Everyone on your team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities, and you will come together to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project.

  ![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/97cb7d0a-1901-440c-b361-73a5a63a0049)

- i.e Project manager is the person who plans the camping, but it does not means that you have to be a camping expert.
  
- **Your job is not to be the expert on everything, instead you are responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support they need in order to complete the project** how?
  
    a. hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. give them specific pieces of the project
    
    b. Ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and establis escalation paths (=communicate riscks to the right people at the right time)
    
    c. understand and help teammates to adopt the right workflows and project management styles (it is your job that the team adheres to that style)
    
    d. collaborate with other teams at the organizations  (your project can affect not only your teams, but other teams. eje finance team)

<ins>Working with cross-functional teams</ins>

- As a project manager, you will likely work with cross-functional teams. A cross-functional team includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project.

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/fca0b701-d10c-4113-a45b-aaa56421fbbd)

Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.

## Acquiring the core skills of a successful project manager

<ins>the core skills for a Project Manager</ins>

- **enabling decision making**: You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness.
  
- **communicating and escalating**: documenting plans, sendindg emails about the status of the project, holding meetings, etc. As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

- **flexibility**: knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed. Plans will change

- **strong organization skills**

    - Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
    - Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
    - Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
    - Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)
    - Industry knowledge> tools, templates, project management styles (like waterfall agile)

<ins> common myths about project manager </ins>

- **Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.**
- **Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.**
-  **Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times**. Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.

case of study

**1. Initiating the project** 
This is the phase Jason rushed through in the first scenario. Ideally, in this phase, Jason discusses project goals with Flight Simulators, Inc. to gain a clear understanding of what they are asking for. Once Jason has defined the project goals, he can gather the stakeholders and project team members to define what needs to be done to successfully create this training for Flight Simulators, Inc. Jason identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company. He presents all of the information he has put together to his company’s leadership team, who approves Jason’s proposal. Jason then submits the proposal to Flight Simulators, Inc., and they accept it. 

**2. Making a plan**
Now that Jason has the green light to work on the project, he makes a project plan to get from start to finish. Having a plan in place ensures that all team members and stakeholders are prepared to complete their tasks. Jason outlines the important deadlines and tasks for the project to be successful. He creates a schedule to account for all resources, materials, and tasks needed to complete the project. 

**3. Executing and completing tasks**
During this project phase, Jason’s project team puts his plan in motion by executing the work. Jason monitors his team as they complete project tasks. His role as the project manager is not to complete the individual tasks but to help break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing their tasks. It is also Jason’s responsibility to communicate schedule and quality expectations. Jason uses his communication skills to keep Flight Simulators, Inc. up to date on the project status and gather feedback from them. This keeps the project on schedule and within budget.

**Closing the project**
Jason’s team has successfully completed the training, and he delivers it to Flight Simulators, Inc. They are very pleased with how it turned out! Jason is now ready to close this project and move on to the next one. Before he closes this chapter, Jason and his team discuss and document the lessons learned from the project. What worked well, and what could work better next time? Jason also puts together a small lunch gathering for his team to celebrate and recognize their hard work.

- celebrate completing the project (the effort)
- formally move on from the project
- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.


## Introduction to project management methodologies

**Close the project**
- project management methodology: a set of a guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle
    - **linear**: means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start (i.e. building a house: have a project/goal and steps in orders, 1 foundations, 2 goals, etc)
    - **iterative**: means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on.

**Overview of Waterfall and Agile**
- Two of the most popular project management methodologies are Waterfall and Agile
  
#### **Waterfall**:  
- Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases (**linear approach : order set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to change**). You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom.
  
**when?**
  - phases of the project are clearly defined
  - one task has to be completed before another begins
  - changes to the project are very expensive to implement onces it's started

#### **Agile**:
tha concepts that shape the methodology emerged at the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products (mainly software applications). In 2001 it eas officialy named Agile.

the term means
- able to to move quicly and easily
- willing to change and adapt
- done in pieces

Agile project phases overlap and task are completed in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints. Scrum is a form of Agile.

Agile is more a mindset than just a series of steps or phases. It's concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client so that they can deliver the best value as quickly as possible and adjust as changes emerge. 

Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like

#### **Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma**:

- Lean Six Sigma is a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma
- The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly.

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/bf176d43-9674-4356-bf47-3f5149690dd5)

- It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment. The idea is that when your team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases and the whole process functions more smoothly. There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach. They are define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, commonly known as DMAIC.

**phases DMAIC (strategy for process improvement)**

1. **Define** the project goal and talk about expectations of the stakeholders (i.e reduce waiting time from 30 to 10 minutes)
2. **Measure**  how the current process is performing in order to improve processes. DMAIC focus on data. you set a plan to get data and how often to measure it. 
3. **Analyze** you will begin to identify gaps and issues
4. **Improve**  you present ypur findings and get ready to satrt making improvements 
5. **Control** Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so the company doesn't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things

 To sum it all up, you can remember DMAIC like this, defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control.    

**Lean Six Sigma**

After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. 

The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.

#### Common project management approaches and how to select one
You have been learning a lot about different project management approaches and when to use them. In this reading, we will briefly recap some of the most common ones and recommend a couple of articles with supporting information. You’ll continue to learn more about these approaches throughout this certificate program. 

**Popular project management approaches **

Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

Kanban is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

Lean uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.
