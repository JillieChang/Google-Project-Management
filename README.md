  **Effective communication** Porject managers deliver value through effective communication, bot with their team and with key stakeholders.
  
## How project managers impact organizations

**a.Focusing on the customer** 

 - customer refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as
budget and deadlines. 2 types>
 - internal: stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments
 - external: customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers
- To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards. To meet the customer’s standards, you have to make sure you clearly understand their expectations
- First, sit with the customer and ask what problem they are trying to solve.
- You might ask if they have a specific vision of the final
outcome they would like delivered.
- Ask questions:

<p align="center";font-size:20pt>
<img  src="https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/d6c11103-3dba-4340-95fe-8883af0362e6)" width="300" height="150" > 
</p> 

- Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

**b.Building a great team** 

**c.Fostering relationshipts and communication** 
- The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.
-  Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

**d.Managing the project** 
- Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.
  
**e.Breaking down barriers**
- Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share
ideas.
- How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try
new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If
your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to
the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule.

**a. Teaching and mentoring**: When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

**b. Building relationships**: Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

**c. Controlling change**: The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

**d.Empowering your team**
We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

**e.Communicating status and concerns**
As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

<ins>A project manager’s role within a team</ins>

- a Project Manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team

    a. hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. give them specific pieces of the project
    
    b. Ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and establis escalation paths (=communicate riscks to the right people at the right time)

    d. collaborate with other teams at the organizations  (your project can affect not only your teams, but other teams. eje finance team)

<ins>Working with cross-functional teams</ins>

- As a project manager, you will likely work with cross-functional teams. A cross-functional team includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project.

Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.

## Acquiring the core skills of a successful project manager

<ins>the core skills for a Project Manager</ins>

- **enabling decision making**: You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness.
  
- **communicating and escalating**: documenting plans, sendindg emails about the status of the project, holding meetings, etc

- **flexibility**: knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed. Plans will change

- **strong organization skills**

    - Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
    - Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
    - Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
    - Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)
    - Industry knowledge> tools, templates, project management styles (like waterfall agile)

<ins> common myths about project manager </ins>

- **Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.**
- **Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.**
-  **Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times**. Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.
