## Understanding the basics of project management
- **What is a project** is a serie of tasks that need to be completed to reach the desired outcome.Reaching that desired outcome involves collaboration and careful planning that keepts the project on track and on budget. IT has a defined begining and end.
- **What is PM? Why is important** It is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requeriments and achieve the desired outcome . It is valuable for business because it ensures that a project delivers the expected outcomes.
- **What does a project manager do?** He/she follow a process that involves **planing and organizing**, **managing tasks**, budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget (and ensure that it brings value to the company)
- **habilities project manager:** manage task, plan an organize, budget and control cost
- **roles**

- project managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of projects
- Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as
- a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs across an entire organization. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary.

# Module 2 : becoming an effective project management

## Exploring how a project manager adds value

<p align="center";font-size:20pt>
<img  src="https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/f00c2eae-fc5e-4d96-b185-7b64b0889564" width="300" height="150" > 
</p>
              
   
  **Priorization**  of task required to complete a project (break large tasks into small ones)
  **Delegation** Project mamangers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can be best complete the work.
  **Effective communication** Porject managers deliver value through effective communication, bot with their team and with key stakeholders.
  
## How project managers impact organizations

**a.Focusing on the customer** 

 - customer refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as
budget and deadlines. 2 types>
 - internal: stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments
 - external: customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers
- To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards. To meet the customer’s standards, you have to make sure you clearly understand their expectations
- First, sit with the customer and ask what problem they are trying to solve.
- You might ask if they have a specific vision of the final
outcome they would like delivered.
- Ask questions:

<p align="center";font-size:20pt>
<img  src="https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/d6c11103-3dba-4340-95fe-8883af0362e6)" width="300" height="150" > 
</p> 

- Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

**b.Building a great team** 

**c.Fostering relationshipts and communication** 
- The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.
-  Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

**d.Managing the project** 
- Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.
  
**e.Breaking down barriers**
- Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share
ideas.
- How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try
new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If
your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to
the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule.

## Learning more about project manager roles and responsibilities

Project manager responsibilities>

**a.planning and organizing** 
- making use of productivity tools and creating processes
- create plans, timeliness, schedules, and other forms of doc. to track the project completition
  
**b.managing tasks**
  - A project task is an activity that nees to be accomplished within a set peeriod of time by you, your team or your stakeholderes.
    
**c.budgeting and controlling costs and other factors**
- monitor and manage the budget
- track issues and risks
- manage quality
- eliminate barries

<ins>Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills</ins>

**a. Teaching and mentoring**: When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

**b. Building relationships**: Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

**c. Controlling change**: The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

**d.Empowering your team**
We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

**e.Communicating status and concerns**
As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

<ins>A project manager’s role within a team</ins>

- a Project Manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team
- he/she is the person who manage the task of the project, what that means?
- Everyone on your team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities, and you will come together to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project.

  ![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/97cb7d0a-1901-440c-b361-73a5a63a0049)

- i.e Project manager is the person who plans the camping, but it does not means that you have to be a camping expert.
  
- **Your job is not to be the expert on everything, instead you are responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support they need in order to complete the project** how?
  
    a. hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. give them specific pieces of the project
    
    b. Ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and establis escalation paths (=communicate riscks to the right people at the right time)
    
    c. understand and help teammates to adopt the right workflows and project management styles (it is your job that the team adheres to that style)
    
    d. collaborate with other teams at the organizations  (your project can affect not only your teams, but other teams. eje finance team)

<ins>Working with cross-functional teams</ins>

- As a project manager, you will likely work with cross-functional teams. A cross-functional team includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project.

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/fca0b701-d10c-4113-a45b-aaa56421fbbd)

Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.

## Acquiring the core skills of a successful project manager

<ins>the core skills for a Project Manager</ins>

- **enabling decision making**: You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness.
  
- **communicating and escalating**: documenting plans, sendindg emails about the status of the project, holding meetings, etc. As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

- **flexibility**: knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed. Plans will change

- **strong organization skills**

    - Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
    - Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
    - Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
    - Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)
    - Industry knowledge> tools, templates, project management styles (like waterfall agile)

<ins> common myths about project manager </ins>

- **Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.**
- **Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.**
-  **Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times**. Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.

case of study

**1. Initiating the project** 
This is the phase Jason rushed through in the first scenario. Ideally, in this phase, Jason discusses project goals with Flight Simulators, Inc. to gain a clear understanding of what they are asking for. Once Jason has defined the project goals, he can gather the stakeholders and project team members to define what needs to be done to successfully create this training for Flight Simulators, Inc. Jason identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company. He presents all of the information he has put together to his company’s leadership team, who approves Jason’s proposal. Jason then submits the proposal to Flight Simulators, Inc., and they accept it. 

**2. Making a plan**
Now that Jason has the green light to work on the project, he makes a project plan to get from start to finish. Having a plan in place ensures that all team members and stakeholders are prepared to complete their tasks. Jason outlines the important deadlines and tasks for the project to be successful. He creates a schedule to account for all resources, materials, and tasks needed to complete the project. 

**3. Executing and completing tasks**
During this project phase, Jason’s project team puts his plan in motion by executing the work. Jason monitors his team as they complete project tasks. His role as the project manager is not to complete the individual tasks but to help break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing their tasks. It is also Jason’s responsibility to communicate schedule and quality expectations. Jason uses his communication skills to keep Flight Simulators, Inc. up to date on the project status and gather feedback from them. This keeps the project on schedule and within budget.

**Closing the project**
Jason’s team has successfully completed the training, and he delivers it to Flight Simulators, Inc. They are very pleased with how it turned out! Jason is now ready to close this project and move on to the next one. Before he closes this chapter, Jason and his team discuss and document the lessons learned from the project. What worked well, and what could work better next time? Jason also puts together a small lunch gathering for his team to celebrate and recognize their hard work.

- communicate results with stakeholders (VIP of the proyect)
- celebrate completing the project (the effort)
- formally move on from the project
- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.


## Introduction to project management methodologies

- project management methodology: a set of a guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle
    - **linear**: means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start (i.e. building a house: have a project/goal and steps in orders, 1 foundations, 2 goals, etc)
    - **iterative**: means some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on.

**Overview of Waterfall and Agile**
- Two of the most popular project management methodologies are Waterfall and Agile
  
#### **Waterfall**:  
- Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases (**linear approach : order set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to change**). You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom.
  
**when?**
  - phases of the project are clearly defined
  - one task has to be completed before another begins
  - changes to the project are very expensive to implement onces it's started

  ![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/a16b0dd3-ca2c-44cf-8d23-07b06dc2447b)

#### **Agile**:
tha concepts that shape the methodology emerged at the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products (mainly software applications). In 2001 it eas officialy named Agile.

the term means
- able to to move quicly and easily
- willing to change and adapt
- done in pieces

Agile project phases overlap and task are completed in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints. Scrum is a form of Agile.

Agile is more a mindset than just a series of steps or phases. It's concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client so that they can deliver the best value as quickly as possible and adjust as changes emerge. 

Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like

#### **Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma**:

- Lean Six Sigma is a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma
- The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly.

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/bf176d43-9674-4356-bf47-3f5149690dd5)

- It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment. The idea is that when your team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases and the whole process functions more smoothly. There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach. They are define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, commonly known as DMAIC.

**phases DMAIC (strategy for process improvement)**

1. **Define** the project goal and talk about expectations of the stakeholders (i.e reduce waiting time from 30 to 10 minutes)
2. **Measure**  how the current process is performing in order to improve processes. DMAIC focus on data. you set a plan to get data and how often to measure it. 
3. **Analyze** you will begin to identify gaps and issues
4. **Improve**  you present ypur findings and get ready to satrt making improvements 
5. **Control** Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so the company doesn't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things

 To sum it all up, you can remember DMAIC like this, defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control.    

**Lean Six Sigma**

After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. 

The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.

------------------

#### Common project management approaches and how to select one
You have been learning a lot about different project management approaches and when to use them. In this reading, we will briefly recap some of the most common ones and recommend a couple of articles with supporting information. You’ll continue to learn more about these approaches throughout this certificate program. 

**Popular project management approaches**

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

**Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

**Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.

# Module 4 : Organizational structure and culture

## 4.1 Understanding organizationl structure

### 4.1.1 Introduction: Organizational structure and culture

you'll learn about organizational structure and culture and how they impact the way you set up and execute your project. You'll also learn about change management, which refers to the way you present the final project to the organization and get them to accept and implement your project outcome.

### 4.1.2 Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

So what is organizational structure? Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization is arranged or structured. In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who.  But organizational structure is much more than that. Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them. 

**Reporting chart or "org chart"**: Reporting charts show the relationship between people and groups within the organization, and details who each person or group reports to. There are a few different types of organizational structures. But for this course, we're going to focus on two of the more popular ones: Classic and Matrix.
  
- **Classic** grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "**top-down**" structures. The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources. You can see this type of structure in effect by looking at a branch of the **military**. **the Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting**

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/d428afb5-6021-48d4-9bb8-b09652dfd779)


- **Matrix**: You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress. These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work.

![image](https://github.com/JillieChang/Google-Project-Management/assets/57914884/29256378-9983-49d1-b8e9-7a6ffa9afd52)


For example, at Google, we have the major functions of marketing, sales, and more, with the traditional reporting chain. But we also have programs for our products, like Google Search, where project teams consist of program managers, engineers, user experience or "UX" designers, and so on, and each team member reports to their own management chains. **the Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.**

### 4.1.3 How organizational structure impacts project management

- One way organizational structure can impact the way you manage a project is by the **amount of authority** given to the project manager. Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization. In some cases, you might have the authority to do things like select the vendors who provide services or goods for the project. Other times, you might have a set of vendors selected for you. Your level of authority and responsibility will vary from project to project.
- Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through **resource availability**. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipotment and budget you need.

  - in a classic organization, you depend on your manager in your org. to aprove resources. If you need more resources, you report to your manager and it to follows the chain of autorithy
  - in a matrix empolyers have more than one manager. you are going to share resources and negotiate priorities.  The key is to make sure you know who your stakeholders are and who controls what since the chain of command isn't always as clearly defined as in the Classic structure

### 4.1.4 The role of a Project Management Office

**What is a PMO?**
A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization’s projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.

**What are the functions of a PMO?**
PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves. The main functions of a PMO include:

- **Strategic planning and governance**: This is the most important function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management. 


- **Best practices**: PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

- **Common project culture**: PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization. 

- **Resource management**: PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular. 

- **Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools**: PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects. They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

## 4.2 Understanding the impact of organizational culture

- Organizational culture is in part the values employees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, history, and so on. In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as the **company's personality.**
- Some cultures emphasizse teamwork and innovation, while others focus on attention to detail and achievement.
- Understanding an organization's culture will help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project. You'll need to be familiar with an organization's culture, so that you can minimize conflict and complete the project with as much support and harmony as possible.
-  **An organization's mission and values can provide clues to its culture**. If you can demonstrate how the project supports the company's mission or how the project aligns with the company's values, you'll have more support from executives and stakeholders to get the approvals and resources you need.
  
    + Pay attention to what leaders in the organization value when conducting business. Does the management team care about speed over perfection?
     + how people comunicate? email, phone, etc
     + how are decisions made? mayority vote or topdown appoval
     + What kid of rotuals are in place when someone new comes to the facility?
     + How are projects typically run? Waterfall, Matrix, etc?
     + What kind of practices, behaviours and values are reflected by the people in the organization

  ### 4.2.1 Navigating Culture: Understanding an organization’s culture
  
-  Once you begin working on a project, here are some ways to navigate company culture that will help you get the most out of your team, and ensure that your project is supported.
- **Ask questions** As you observe the culture, try asking your peers what they think is going well and what they would change. Your peers may have the same opinion as you, and if not you may learn something new you didn't learn in the interview process. Either way, you'll be in a better place to assess risk, adjust your current project, or be more prepared for projects in the future.

        Atmosphere 
        
            + How do people typically share credit at this company?
            + Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
            + How do managers support and motivate their team?
            + When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
         
         Policies
         
            + What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
            + Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
         
         Processes
         
            + What is the company’s onboarding process?
            + How do employees measure the impact of their work?
            
        Values
           + What are the company’s mission and value statements?
           + How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
           + How does the organization support professional development and career growth?  


- **Make observations**. It's important to understand how things work, and what people like and respect about the company's culture. When working in different geographies, it's also importan to check established customs like shaking hands
  
- **Understand your impact**

### 4.2.2 The importance of organizational culture

- **Identity**: An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its **personality.** That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave. 

- **People:** Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.

- **Processes:** Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture. 

### 4.2.3 Take note of company rituals

Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 
- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 
- Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 
- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature?
- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles?

### 4.2.4 Understand your impact

As a project manager, you become a change agent. Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.

### 4.2.5 Sharpen your communication skills

Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.

              Example: The Family Java
              The Family Java coffeehouse has over 2,000 stores worldwide. The Family Java’s culture is closely linked to their strategy and capabilities—this is what they feel sets them apart from other coffee shops. The company has invested in a relationship-driven, employees-first approach.
              
             **Mission**
              To provide a welcoming environment where our employees become our family and our guests become our friends
              
              **Values**
              To create a place where everyone is welcome
              To always give our best and hold ourselves accountable for the results
              To treat others with respect and kindness

## 4.3 Understanding change management

Sometimes the deliverable of a project is a new tool or new process that must be adopted by the organization. 

. change management: the process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it. 
. Understanding change management can ensure that a project is completed successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the project. For example, if you are launching a new time tracking system for employees, the project wouldn't be successful if the employees didn't adopt the new system. When you understand change management and your role in the process, it can ensure a smooth roll out of changes and easier adoption. 

- Though there are lots of different models, they all share the same general concepts. **Change management in project management is centered around three core concepts and best practices**. 
    1. The **first core**concept is creating a sense of ownership and urgency around the project. When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome.
         + **Ownership** means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks.
         + **Urgency** means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along.
           
      2. Another core concept is to figure out the **right combination of skills and personalities** when selecting the people who will work on your team. Find people whose knowledge and skills complement one another. If your team is selected for you, see if you're able to choose who gets assigned which tasks. If that's not possible, then it's extra important for you to find ways to connect with your team. This will get them excited about the project so then they can be advocates for change when it's needed. One effective way of motivating your team is to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project. Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen. Communicating this idea clearly allows others to share in your vision and take ownership in bringing it to life. The final core concept is the ever important one, effective communication. And I can't stress this enough: communication is key. Having effective communication with your
