<p style="text-align:justify"> In this tutorial we will create a Word Cloud from a sample of nameless tweets extracted from Twitter for the period 3/16/2020 - 08/31/2020 in Peru. The dataset was modificated to respect Twitter private information policy and is used just as an example to show how to create a Word Cloud.  </p>



We will do different examples of Word Clouds by using the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Install packages and import libraries </li>
  <li>Import the dataset, clean it up and select the text you are going to work with (tweets) </li>
  <li>Perform the text preprocessing and create a clean variable </li>
  <li>Create your Word Cloud:
    <p>  </p>  
      <ul> 
    
      </ul>
  </li>
  <p>  </p>     
  <li>Finally, you can review Bibliography to look for more information.. </li>   
</ol>
