## How project managers impact organizations

**a.Focusing on the customer** 

 - customer refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as
budget and deadlines. 2 types>
 - internal: stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments
 - external: customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers
- To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards. To meet the customer’s standards, you have to make sure you clearly understand their expectations

outcome they would like delivered.

</p> 

- Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

**b.Building a great team** 
**c.Fostering relationshipts and communication** 
- The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.
-  Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

**d.Managing the project** 
- Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.
  
**e.Breaking down barriers**
- Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share
ideas.
- How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try
new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If
your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to
the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule.
